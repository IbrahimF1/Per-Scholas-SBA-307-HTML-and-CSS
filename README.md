Using HTML and CSS I created a four-page portfolio site for Linus Torvalds. The website maintains a consistent user experience through a shared Bootstrap navbar and a Flexbox-driven content grid. A wide array of semantic tags, including header, article, and main, are used to structure diverse content like text, images, and a background GIF. User interaction is handled via a site search, a contact form, and a responsive dropdown menu built into the navigation for mobile devices.

On the styling front, I used CSS by using external stylesheets for global rules with inline styles for specific overrides. The complementary color palette allows for a cohesive visual identity, while the responsive layout is managed using both Bootstrap for the navigation and CSS Flexbox for content alignment. The design has two types of CSS animations: keyframe animations to create a dynamic background on the contact page, and transitions to provide interactive feedback on buttons and gallery images.
